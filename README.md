# 👋 Hi, I’m Mordecai Wambua  
### 🔑 Backend Specialist | API Architect | Cloud-Native Developer  

I design **scalable Node.js APIs**, optimize **MongoDB/Redis** performance, and deploy **containerized microservices**. Passionate about solving complex problems with clean, maintainable code.


## 📝 About Me
I’m a backend-heavy MERN-stack engineer passionate about designing and implementing scalable, secure web applications. With a foundation in Software Engineering and hands-on experience building RESTful APIs, microservices, and full-stack projects, I strive to deliver production-ready solutions that solve real-world problems.

- 🎓 **BSc Software Engineering** (in progress) at **MultiMedia University of Kenya**
- 📜 **ALX Africa Software Engineering Certified**
- ⚙️ Strong backend focus with expertise in Node.js/Express, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, and AWS
- 🌱 Constantly learning new patterns in microservices, performance tuning, and cloud-native deployments
- 🤝 Open to collaboration on challenging web-development and API-architecture projects

## 🔑 What I Do
- **Backend Architecture & APIs**  
  Design RESTful and GraphQL APIs using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript. Implement authentication (JWT, OAuth2), role-based access control, and robust error/exception handling.
- **Database Design & Optimization**  
  Model and optimize schemas in MongoDB and MySQL. Implement indexing strategies, caching layers with Redis, and practice sharding/replication for high-throughput applications.
- **Containerization & Deployment**  
  Containerize applications with Docker and deploy using AWS ECS/EKS, DigitalOcean Kubernetes, or Heroku. Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployments.
- **Frontend Integration (MERN)**  
  Build responsive React frontends with functional components, hooks, and state management (Redux Toolkit, Context API). Ensure accessibility, code splitting, and performance best practices.
- **Testing & Quality Assurance**  
  Write unit and integration tests with Jest, Mocha/Chai for the backend, and React Testing Library/Cypress for frontend. Maintain ≥80% test coverage and enforce linting/formatting with ESLint and Prettier.
